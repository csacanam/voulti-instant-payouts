# 💸 Voulti Instant Payouts

### Global payouts in PYUSD, settled instantly in local stablecoins.

---

## 🌍 Overview

**Voulti Payouts** is a multi-chain payout dashboard that allows global merchants to send payments in **PYUSD** and automatically distribute local stablecoins — such as **cCOP (Colombia)**, **BRL1 (Brazil)**, and **MXNB (Mexico)** — to their recipients.

The project was built for **ETHOnline 2025**, as part of the **PayPal USD track**, with the goal of demonstrating how **PYUSD** can become a real settlement rail for cross-border payments in emerging markets.

## 🧠 Problem

Today, millions of freelancers, creators, and service providers in Latin America receive international payments through platforms like PayPal, but:

- Transfers are **slow** and **expensive**.
- Converting USD to local currency often means **losing up to 10% in fees**.
- Access to banking or PayPal withdrawals is limited in many regions.

PYUSD solves the digital dollar part — but not the **last mile** of local liquidity.

## 💡 Solution

**Voulti Payouts** bridges that gap by enabling **both single and bulk payouts**.

Merchants or platforms can:

1. Fund their account in **PYUSD**.
2. Choose between:
   - 💸 **Single payout** – send one payment directly to a recipient in their local stablecoin.
   - 📦 **Bulk payouts** – upload a list of multiple recipients with payout amounts and countries.
3. Run the payment(s), and Voulti automatically handles the routing, conversion, and delivery of funds in the **correct local stablecoin** and **network**.

For example:

- 🇲🇽 Mexico → **MXNB** on Arbitrum
- 🇨🇴 Colombia → **cCOP** on Celo
- 🇧🇷 Brazil → **BRL1** on Polygon

The result: fast, transparent, and affordable payouts that feel native to each market — whether it’s one payment or hundreds.

## ⚙️ MVP Scope

The MVP focuses on two simple flows:

- **Single Payout:** A merchant sends one payment in PYUSD, and the recipient instantly receives the equivalent in their local stablecoin.
- **Bulk Payouts:** The merchant executes **10 payouts in one click**, distributing PYUSD into cCOP, MXNB, and BRL1 across different networks.

Both flows are tracked through a dashboard that displays:

- Current **PYUSD balance**
- **Total paid** in USD
- **Number of payouts executed**
- **Countries reached**
- Average **settlement time**

---

## 🚀 Vision

Our mission is to make **global payouts truly borderless** — where digital dollars like PYUSD flow seamlessly into local stablecoins across emerging economies.

In the long term, **Voulti Payouts** aims to serve as the foundation for:

- Real-time cross-border payrolls
- Creator economy payments
- On-chain settlement for marketplaces and platforms
