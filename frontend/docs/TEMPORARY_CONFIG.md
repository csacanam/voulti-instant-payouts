# ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporary Configuration - Hidden Menus

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Reason:** Focus on Payouts module development  
**Status:** TEMPORARY

---

## üö´ Currently Hidden

The following menus are temporarily hidden during development:

- **Home** (`/`) - Dashboard with metrics and quick actions
- **Receive** (`/receive`) - Payment links and commerce link
- **Activity** (`/activity`) - All transactions with filters

## ‚úÖ Currently Active

- **Payouts** (`/payouts`) - Main focus for development
  - Default route when accessing `/`
  - Only visible menu in navigation

---

## üîÑ How to Restore All Menus

When ready to restore all functionality, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Restore Navigation Menu

**File:** `frontend/components/main-nav.tsx`

**Current (Hidden):**

```typescript
// TEMPORARY: Only Payouts menu visible for development
// To restore all menus, see docs/TEMPORARY_CONFIG.md
const navItems = [
  // { href: "/", label: "Home", icon: Home }, // HIDDEN: Temporarily disabled
  // { href: "/receive", label: "Receive", icon: QrCode }, // HIDDEN: Temporarily disabled
  { href: "/payouts", label: "Payouts", icon: Receipt },
  // { href: "/activity", label: "Activity", icon: Activity }, // HIDDEN: Temporarily disabled
];
```

**Restore to:**

```typescript
const navItems = [
  { href: "/", label: "Home", icon: Home },
  { href: "/receive", label: "Receive", icon: QrCode },
  { href: "/payouts", label: "Payouts", icon: Receipt },
  { href: "/activity", label: "Activity", icon: Activity },
];
```

### Step 2: Restore Home Page

**File:** `frontend/app/page.tsx`

**Current (Redirect to Payouts):**

```typescript
"use client";

// TEMPORARY: Redirect to /payouts during development
// To restore Home page, see docs/TEMPORARY_CONFIG.md

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

export default function Home() {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    router.replace("/payouts");
  }, [router]);

  return null;
}

// ORIGINAL HOME PAGE CODE - COMMENTED OUT TEMPORARILY
// Uncomment this and remove the redirect above to restore Home page
/* ... original code ... */
```

**Restore to:**

1. **Delete** lines 1-17 (redirect code)
2. **Uncomment** the entire block starting with `/*` (line 21)
3. **Remove** the closing `*/` at the end

### Step 3: Verify All Pages Work

After restoring, test all routes:

- ‚úÖ `/` - Should show Home dashboard
- ‚úÖ `/payouts` - Should show Payouts list
- ‚úÖ `/receive` - Should show Receive options
- ‚úÖ `/receive/links` - Should show Payment Links
- ‚úÖ `/receive/commerce-link` - Should show Commerce Link
- ‚úÖ `/receive/developers` - Should show Developers (Coming Soon)
- ‚úÖ `/activity` - Should show Activity list
- ‚úÖ `/account` - Should show Account profile
